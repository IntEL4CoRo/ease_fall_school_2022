    "Welcome to the first challenge. Everything before was just messing around with the setup and basics for Lisp and CRAM. You've learned how to write Lisp code, define functions and parameters, create and visualize poses, and how to use one of the key components of CRAM: Designators. Now we will utilize all of that by making the robot pick and place objects from one place to another.\n",

    "To use CRAM in this lesson we need to clean up a bit. Close the last Bullet World window. It is bound to the kernel of lesson 2, so it can't communicate with it when we work here in lesson 3. Then load the package, initialize the simulator again and define the tutorial package for your own code."
