Tip: You can use event_interval(*Action*, *Start*, *End*), where *Action* is the given action, and *Start* and *End* the start- and endtimepoint of the action. Use number*End*) to ensure that *Start* and *End* is bound to a rational number. To obtain the executed task you can use the property *dul:executesTask*.
