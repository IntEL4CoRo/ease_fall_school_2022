# Hands-on Course on Cognitive Robot Perception: RoboSherlock

Developing cognition-enabled robot agents that can competently perform complex human-like everyday manipulation tasks such as cooking in a realistic kitchen has been a worthful challenge. However, perception has been a major bottleneck to this goal. That is, the perception system should provide, given reasonable computational resources, appropriate information about the world state for effective and successful manipulation. In this hands-on session, we will highlight some core challenges of robot perception systems, ranging from task-related over sensor-related to domain-related challenges. Then, we will present RoboSherlock, a cognitive robot perception framework that attempts to capture and emulate features of biological cognition (e.g., commonsense, learning) in order to address these challenges. Finally, we will interactively demonstrate RoboSherlock, where each student will be able to download, install and run the framework, giving therefore the student the opportunity to familiarize with the development of perception systems or to learn about the use and features of RoboSherlock for future works.
